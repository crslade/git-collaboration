My final project 


THOUGHT SNIPPET FOR MY FINAL PROJECT -

Hope to make a website that imitates social media fucntionalities, this idea might change or become more fleshed out later
for now, this is what comes immedietly to my mind but this is subject to change.

I want to make a very simple website that kinda functions like twitter or reddit. I want users to make posts for now consisting of strings and images. 
Users may also comment on it. Entities consist of users, posts, daily quotes. These will be the sections you can access. I am writing the baseline, I would like to employ 
creativity of course and go beyond that but setting a baseline this is what I would like to acheive.
